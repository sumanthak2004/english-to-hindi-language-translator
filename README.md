# Language-Translation-From-English-Hindi-Using-Rnns
In this project, we built a deep neural network that functions as part of a machine translation. The project accepts English text as input and returns the Hindi translation. The goal is to achieve the highest translation accuracy possible.

## Abstract

This project explores English-to-Hindi translation using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), leveraging deep learning to address linguistic differences between the two languages. RNNs are well-suited for language translation tasks as they process sequences of data by maintaining contextual information across words. By utilizing an encoder-decoder architecture with RNNs, the model captures the meaning of English sentences and generates accurate Hindi translations. Attention mechanisms enhance this process by dynamically focusing on specific words in the input sequence, addressing long-distance dependencies, and improving translation quality. The model is trained on a large parallel corpus of English and Hindi sentences, with performance evaluated on translation accuracy, fluency, and semantic relevance. This approach not only demonstrates the effectiveness of RNNs in machine translation but also highlights the nuances required to handle languages with distinct syntactic and grammatical structures.

## Conclusion:
The Hindi-English Truncated Corpus dataset contains 127607 parallel sentences in Hindi and English, preprocessed and filtered for quality. It is a useful resource for natural language processing tasks such as machine translation and text classification and can serve as a benchmark dataset for evaluating the performance of different models and techniques in this field.
